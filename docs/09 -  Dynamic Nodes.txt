 Dynamic Nodes
    
    Dynamic nodes are nodes that Urtext compiles and updates from content in other nodes, as they change in real time. Dynamic node definitions are enclosed in double square brackets and can be inserted into any node arbitrarily. Press Ctrl-Shift-] to insert a dynamic node definition.

    The definition has the following keys:
        
        - ID: (required) : This will be auto-populated by Sublime when using the shortcut above; however you can also replace it with the ID of another node. For example, if you want the contents to replace an existing node, copy and paste that node's ID. If you want it to populate new inline node, create that node and then copy/paste its ID.

        - include:metadata:(tag name):(tag values) (optional) : Include nodes with this metadata key and value. Keys and values are chained together and separated by the colon (:) as shown above. To include multiple key/value pairs, write multiple lines.

        - exclude:metadata:(tag name):(tag values) (optional) : Exclude nodes with this metadata key and value. Keys and values are strung together and separated by the colon (:) as shown above. To exclude multiple key/value pairs, write multiple lines. Excluding will always supersede including, no matter the order listed in the definition. 

        - sort:index:(numerical index) (optional) : How to sort the nodes in the dynamically populated node. Currently, this can be only be 'index'. The index is a zero-padded number between 00 and 99 that determines sort order.

        - metadata:(tag name):(value) (optional) : Metadata to add to the dynamically populated node. This can be any metadata, including the reserved title, index and parent keys.

        - tree: (root id) : Populates the node with a tree with the provided node ID as root.

        Dynamic nodes will always automatically include the metadata key 'defined in' which will point to the node containing its definition.

    Here are four inline nodes with example tags and indexes:

{{ Example Source Node 1
 /-- ID:017; tag: example_node; index:02 --/ }}
                       
{{ Example Source Node 3
   /-- ID: 01b; tag: example_node; index:01 --/ }}

{{ Example Source Node 2
/-- tag: example_node | exclude_this --/ /-- ID:00v --/ }}

{{ Example Source Node 4
   /-- ID: 01c; tag: example_node; index:05  --/ }}


    Here is an example dynamic node definition targeting node ID >018

        [[ ID:016
            include:metadata:tag:example_node
            exclude:metadata:tag:exclude_this
            sort:index
            show:title
            metadata:title:Example Dynamic Node Title
            indent:4
        ]] >018

    Here is the compiled node defined by the definition above. Changing the dynamic definition and/or the contents or metadata of the source nodes will update the dynamic node. Saving is necessary to trigger the update.

    {{
    Example Dynamic Node Title
    - Example Source Node 3 >01b
    - Example Source Node 1 >017
    - Example Source Node 4 >01c
    /-- 
    title: Example Dynamic Node Title
    ID: 016
    defined in: >01r
    --/}}
        
{{ Another Example: The Node Definition for the Table of Contents

    Here is the dynamic definition that generates the table of contents for this documentation:

        [[ ID:01a
            tree:a5m
            metadata:title:Table of Contents
            metadata:flags:exclude_from_tree
         ]]  

    Changing the titles or nesting of sections in this document will dynamically update the tree.

     /-- ID: 029 --/}}
                                                                                              

/-- ID: 01r
