More About Node IDs

	The purpose of Node IDs is to uniquely identify each piece of content (node) in a project. This allows free file naming and renaming without breaking links within a project.

	Nodes IDs are three characters long and incorporate all ten digits (0 - 9) and all letters a - z. This results in over 46,000 possible unique identifiers per project.

	Node IDs are generated automatically by the Urtext project; every newly created node is assigned the next available (unused) ID. 

	Although IDs loosely represent order of node creation within a project, node 000 being the first and each digit being incremented by number and then by letter for subsequently created nodes, the IDs have no special meaning. When an ID is deleted or removed from the project, new nodes are assigned to vacant node IDs before the numerically last ID is incremented.

	Node IDs can also be user-created arbitrarily if for some reason you want to. They will compile provided the ID is not a duplicate. If you do this, note that node IDs are case-insensitive; this is so that they can also used as filenames (for file-level nodes) as needed.

	Control-Shift-I will insert a new and unused node anywhere in the project, in case you delete one or want to insert one manually.

	If more than one Node ID appears in a node, only the first one is read and the rest are treated (indexed) as regular metadata.
