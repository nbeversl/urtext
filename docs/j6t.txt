Compact Nodes

	For nodes that can fit on a single line, such as items in a list, short phrases, word definitions, and so on, you can use a simplified node syntax. Begin the line with the caret symbol (^); the closing wrapper then becomes the next newline (the end of the same line). Like other nodes:

^ require an ID /-- id: frm --/
^ can have arbitrary other metadata /-- ID: xlc --/
^ become child nodes of their containing node. /-- ID: hiz --/
