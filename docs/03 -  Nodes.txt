Writing Nodes

Text is kept in nodes. Think of a node as a blank piece of paper, or a blank region of paper, either one with flexible and open-ended length.

A node can be a file but a file can also contain multiple nodes. In this system, it's clearer and more useful to think of text regions as nodes than as files.


{{ Node Identity (Node IDs)

 	Nodes are uniquely identified by a three-character ID, automatically generated by Urtext on node creation and placed into the initial metadata region. The identity of a node within Urtext persists no matter its containing filename.

	Every node must have an ID; files with nodes missing IDs cannot be compiled and are omitted from the project.

	{{ Generating a node ID manually /-- tags:sublime --/

		If you accidentally delete a Node ID or need to insert one arbitrarily, press Control-Shift-I. /-- id: a0i--/ }}

	Node IDs have no special meaning except as a unique identifier. IDs are covered more in (>01q).

   /-- ID:01h --/ }}

{{ File Level Nodes

	A file-level node is the node at the outermost level of a single file. It may or may not contain other nodes.

	{{ Creating a File Level Node

		The file is created, named and saved automatically. It has whitespace on top and a metadata block at the bottom containing a node ID and a timestamp of the creation date and time.

		{{ (Python)

			%%-PYTHON

				myproject.new_file_node(date=datetime.datetime.now(), metadata = {}, node_id=None)
				"""
				Kwargs:
					date (datetime): the timestamp, defaults to now if not specified
					metadata (dict): key/value metadata pairs
					node_id (str): optionally specify a node_id (rarely used)
				Returns:
					dict: { 'filename' : # (str) : the new filename, without path
							'id': # (str) the new node_id 
							}
				"""

		{{ (Sublime) /-- tags:sublime --/

			Press Control-Shift-; (Control-Shift-semicolon). 
			/-- id: xo8; --/ }}

	/--  id: ekz	--/ }}

	By default, the first non-whitespace line of any node is the node's title. Write a title and anything else into the node. Save it as usual (Super-S in Sublime).
