Node Metadata
    
    Metadata is data about the content, in the form of key/value pairs and timestamps. Other than a few reserved key/value pairs used for compiling, metadata is open for user-defined purposes. Keys and values of metadata tags are indexed automatically and searchable within the Urtext project (see >012). 

    Metadata regions in Urtext open with a forward-slash followed by two dashes and close with two dashes followed by a forward slash. Each metadata entry is a key/value pair, separated by a colon, with the value containing an optional timestamp. Examples:

        /-- purpose: work-related <Tue., Mar. 05, 2019, 07:25 PM> --/
        /-- kind: gift_list --/

    The only required metadata is a node ID. Additional user-defined metadata can be added into the same region, and additional metadata regions can be inserted arbitrarily anywhere inside a node. You can also string several entries together on one line, separated by semicolons:

        /-- note: example note ; tag: groceries --/

    Note that: 

        -   A colon separates the key from the value 

        -   All three components are optional; any content preceding a colon (if one is present) is interpreted as a key; content following the (first) colon is interpreted as a value. If no colon is present, the entry is read as a key with an empty value.

        -   A timestamp anywhere in the value will be indexed as the timestamp for the whole metadata entry. If more than on timestamp appears in an entry, only the first one is indexed.

        -   Values are not case-sensitive, except for the values of the following keys:

                title
                notes
                timestamp_format 
                    ( used in the project_settings node only : see >00l)
                filenames 

{{ Reserved Metadata Keys
                                                   
    There are three reserved metadata keys:

       {{   title
       
            If you want to override the automatic title and assign a title manually, use title tag in the metadata block: /-- title: title (overrides the default title)  --/

        /-- ID:00y --/ }}

       {{   index
       
            You can optionally add a two-digit sort index (00-99) to a node, such as:

               /-- index: 03 --/    

            Index tags will sort the files in the Node List (>01i) . Any indexed nodes will sort before (above) the others, with lowest number appearing first. 

            Remember unindexed notes display in order of creation, newest first, based on the value of the timestamp. You can give the same index number to multiple nodes; in this case they sort with the most recent node first, within each index.

            /-- ID:00z --/ }}

        {{  flags

            The `flags` key is used to set node behavior. At present only the following exists:

            {{- exclude_from_tree

                Excludes a node from being included in a tree. For an example, see Example 2 in "Dynamic Nodes" >029. For more on tree, see >00h  /-- id: 1e3 --/ }}

        /-- id: cwb--/ }}
          
    The only additional reserved metadata keys apply only to the project_settings node (>00l).
                   
    /-- ID:011 --/ }}
