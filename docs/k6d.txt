Split Nodes

A node region can be split into two separate nodes using the `%` character as the first character on a line. The `%` character is the syntactic equivalent of two closing curly braces followed by a space and two opening curly braces, closing the previous node and opening new one.

This node must contain its own ID (above).

Note using a `%` symbol at the file level (outside of an inline node wrapper) is equivalent to dividing the file into multiple parts; inline nodes generated inside any of these parts will be children only of their containing node, not of any other root nodes in the same file.
