Setup

{{  Making a New Project /-- ID: dce --/

%		(Python)

		Pass a system path to UrtextProject(): 
		
		%%-PYTHON

			from urtext.project import UrtextProject
			path = '~/users/someone/path/to/project/folder'
			my_project = UrtextProject(path)

		%%-END

		/-- id: n2m --/ /-- tags:python --/
    
%	  	(Sublime)

	    To make an empty project, make a new folder (or open an existing folder, if you want to create a new project there) and open the folder in Sublime. Select Urtext : Initialize Project from the Sublime Command Palette. Then press Ctrl-Shift-; to create a new node.

     /-- ID:00a --/ }}

 {{ Using Existing Files

    To use existing plaintext files, you must append the `ID` (>01e) and `Timestamp` (>00j) metadata keys and values to the file, along with the current date and time to show when the file was added to the Urtext Project. See >00x for more information on Metadata.

    {{  (Python) /-- tags:python --/
    	
    	Pass the keyword argument `import_project=True`:

    	%%-PYTHON

			from urtext.project import UrtextProject
			path = '~/users/someone/path/to/project/folder'
			my_project = UrtextProject(path, import_project=True)

		%%-END

    /-- id: b44 --/ }}

	{{  (Sublime) /-- tags:sublime --/

	    Select `Urtext : Import Project` from the Sublime Command palette.

	    Note that the append will occur without a confirmation dialog, so if you are just experimenting with this system, consider making a copy of your file folder so you can revert without having to manually remove the metadata./-- id: rij --/ }}

    /-- ID:00b --/ }}

{{  Sublime Project /-- tags:sublime --/
	
	(not to be confused with an Urtext Project -- see https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/projects.html )

	You don't need to define a Sublime Project for the Urtext Project, but if you intend to do more than one thing at a time in Sublime, it's convenient to have one; you can then use Select Project -> Quick Switch Project (Ctrl-Cmd-P) to switch among them.  

	/-- id: c3n --/ }}

{{  Reopening a Project /-- tags:sublime --/

	Once the Sublime package is installed, it will always look for any files with the .txt extension in open folders and attempt to compile them. To open an existing Urtext project, open the folder, a file in the folder, or a Sublime project that includes the folder, and any feature described in this documentation will work.

{{  Sublime Text Interface Tips
	
	Here are some tips for best leveraging Sublime's great UI features.

	{{ Syntax Highlighting

		This package comes with a .YML file (sublime_urtext.sublime_syntax) defining the Urtext syntax, along with two color schemes that provide syntax highlighting. Syntax highlighting makes everything easier by showing depth of node nesting and dimming certain elements of the syntax. Select the Sixteen (for light) or Monokai (for dark) color schemes in Preferences -> Color Scheme ... 

		Then change to the Urtext syntax by selecting it in View -> Syntax -> Urtext. To avoid having to do this for every file, select View -> Syntax -> Open All with Current Extension As ... -> Urtext. (You can undo this later by repeating the same but selecting Plain Text.) /-- ID: 01d --/}}

	{{	Hiding Tabs

			If you prefer a clean, terminal-like view, hide tabs: View -> Hide Tabs
			This preference can also be set on a per-(Sublime)-project basis. See the Sublime documentation.  

				/-- ID:015 --/ }}

	{{  Hiding Line Numbers

			For an extra-clean look, hide line numbers by adding:
				"settings" : {
					 "line_numbers": false,
				},

			... to your Sublime project settings file.
			
			/-- ID:01e --/ }}

	{{  Full Screen / Distraction Free Mode

			Since you can navigate entirely from within files, Urtext works great in Sublime's Distraction Free Mode. View -> Enter Distraction Free Mode

		/-- ID:002 --/ }}

		{{ Disable Prompts for File Reload

			 Urtext does a lot of writing to files on the fly, often when they are already open. To avoid seeing a dialog every time, add add the following to your Sublime project settings or User Preferences file:
				 "settings" : {
					"always_prompt_for_file_reload": false,
				},
