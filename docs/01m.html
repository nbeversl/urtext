<div class="urtext_line">Since node identities are independent of their containing filenames, you can use any naming convention you want, for purposes such as browsing files via the file system, reading and editing nodes using mobile apps, etc.</div>
<div class="urtext_line">Urtext can also rename files automatically in convenient formats based on their title and/or index. Renaming by index is useful, for instance, if you want to see file-level nodes appear in a file system, mobile app, or other file browser in the same order they appear within Sublime Urtext.</div>
<div class="urtext_line">To rename a file, select "Rename File from Meta" from the command palette (Command-P). This will rename the file in one of the following schema:</div>
<div class="urtext_line">If an index is present:</div>
<div class="urtext_line"><index> <title>.txt</div>
<div class="urtext_line">If no index is present:</div>
<div class="urtext_line"><node id> <title>.txt</div>
<div class="urtext_line">This system preserves automatic numerical sorting within the filesystem, such that the most recent un-indexed nodes appear first. If you want to use another system, such as putting the title first, you can do so.</div>
