'project_settings.txt' : """

This is the `project_settings` node. In the metadata you can specify settings for the project.

project_settings 

    always_oneline_meta::False
        When creating a new node, sets whether the metadata will appear on one line separated by semicolon, or on separate lines.

    breadcrumb_key::
        When popping nodes, optionally adds a breadcrumb showing which node the popped node was popped from, and the timestamp.

    case_sensitive::title - notes - comments - project_title - timezone - timestamp_format - filenames - weblink - timestamp
        Specifies which keys' contents should be parsed case-sensitive.

    console_log::True
        (True or False): Sets whether Urtext will log updates, errors, messages to Sublime's Python console.
        (Press Control-tilde(~)  to open the console)

    console_log::True
        Output errors and messages to the Python console (Sublime Text)

    contents_strip_internal_whitespace::True
        When including contents in dynamic nodes, determines whether internal multiline whitespace gets stripped from the dynamic output.

    contents_strip_outer_whitespace::True
        When including contents in dynamic nodes, determines whether leading or trailing whitespace gets stripped from the dynamic output.

    exclude_files::
        Sets filenames in the project folder to be excluded from the project, if any.

    exclude_from_star::title - _newest_timestamp - _oldest_timestamp - _breadcrumb - def
        When marking metadata using the * and ** syntax, these keys will get omitted, if present.

    filename_title_length::100
        Sets a maximum title length (in characters) when using | Reindex Files >qd2

    filenames::INDEX - title
        Specifies format for filenames when using >Reindex Files< and 
        Any metadata key used in the project is valid, in addition to the PREFIX placeholder, which will apply a numerical prefix to the outputted filename.

    filename_datestamp_format::%m-%d-%Y
        Specifies how dates will be formatted in filenames when using 

    file_index_sort::index - _oldest_timestamp
        When using Reindex Files with an index prefix, specifies the order in which the files should be indexed. For more information | Reindex Files >qd2

    hash_key::test
        The keyname to use for the hash mark metadata shortcut. See >Hash Key

    history_interval::10
        Sets the interval (in seconds) at which history snapshots should be taken of your views. Increase the interval to have smaller .diff files in your /history folder. Decrease it to have more granular edit history.

    home::Home Node
        Identifies the home node for the project, connected to the "Home" key
        For example, Press Ctrl-Shift-H to go to the Home node of this documentation

    import::False
        If set to true, all new text files added to the project folder get imported automatically on the fly by adding an Urtext Node ID.

    open_with_system::pdf 
        File extensions to always open using the default system application.

    new_file_node_format::New File Created $timestamp\n$cursor
        Specifies the default format for new file nodes. The following values can be string together in any way:
            $timestamp
            $device_keyname
            $cursor - where to position the cursor
            any other Unicode characters are valid â€” arbitrary text, newlines (\r), etc.

    node_browser_sort::index - oldest_timestamp
        Specifies the key order by which nodes will sort in the Node Browser dropdown

    node_date_keyname::timestamp
        When creating a new node, if the node gets a timestamp key, this sets the keyname.

    numerical_keys::_index - index
        Sets keys that should always be interpreted numerically for sorting and processing in dynamic output.

    project_title::Reference Documentation
        Provides a title for the entire project

    tag_other::
        Accepts two values which will be interpreted as key/value.
        When quick-tagging a node from another (see >Quick Tag from Other: ctrl + shift + 0<), this metadata entry will be the 
        one added.

    timestamp_format::%a., %b. %d, %Y, %I:%M %p
        Set the format of the timestamp when using > Insert Timestamp: ctrl + shift + t <
        This accepts a Python `strftime` directive. For possible format strings, see https://strftime.org/

    timezone::US/Eastern
        Specifices a timezone to which the timestamp keys should be localized, or, if including a timezone in the `timestamp_format`, what timezone to include.

    title::project_settings
        Title reserved key is used here to specificy this node as containing project_settings.

    use_timestamp::updated - timestamp - inline-timestamp - _oldest_timestamp - _newest_timestamp
        Specifies keys for which the timestamp component should be used instead of the text value.
