SORT() _ #call

By default, included nodes are sorted alphabetically by ID.
SORT enables sorting by any other metadata key, including | System Keys >

Arguments are keynames with optional flags.

Example:
[[
+(*)
SORT(title -r)
LIMIT(15)
TREE()
>(| Example Use of SORT() >) ]]

Includes all nodes in the project, sorts them in reverse order by title, and limits the results to 15.

Output:
