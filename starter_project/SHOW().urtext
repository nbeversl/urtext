SHOW() _ #call

By default, and use of INCLUDE() outputs a link for every node included.
SHOW() modifies the output to a custom template.

Supplies a template to customize output of each result.
Accepts keynames, denoted with `$`, arbitrary t

Words preceded by `$` are are evaluated as metadata keys, replaced in the output by their value(s).
Note that key names themselves are not displayed in the output. Add keynames manually if you want them included.

	{ Parameters _

	  SHOW accepts format strings, which are metadata keys, including | System Keys >, preceded by the dollar sign `$`. SORT will also accept arbitrary text or Unicode, such as newlines, tabs, and so on. The following format strings are also available:

	  `$title`
	  Displays the node title, default or via the `title` meta key

	  `$_link`
	  Displays a link to the node

	  `$_pointer`
	  Displays a link to the node

	  `$_meta`
	  Shorthand to show all metadata for every node, formatted as by "consolidate metadata"

	  `$_contents`
	  Displays the contents of the node.

	  `$_lines:[number]`
	  Displays the first [number] lines of the node.

	  `$_lines:[number],[number]`
	  Displays the range lines of the node with the first number as starting line and the second number as ending line.

	  `$[any_other_metadata_key]`
	  The `$` sign may be followed by any other metadata key in the project and its value or values will be shown.
	  Note in this case the leading underscore is not present, unless it is used in your project.
