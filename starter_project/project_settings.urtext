project_settings _

Any node with the title "project_settings" provides special metadata keys that affect the project globally. To create one, make a node and title it "project_settings". (The other text content of the node does not matter.) You can have more than one "project_settings" node.

True/false values can be written as on/off, true/false, or yes/no, all case-insensitive.

The settings in this starter project are the defaults.

pop_breadcrumb_key::popped_from
When popping nodes, optionally adds a breadcrumb showing which node the popped node was popped from, and the timestamp. See | POP > and | PULL > and for more information.

case_sensitive_keys::title - project_title - timestamp_format - filenames - timestamp
Specifies which keysâ€™ values should be parsed case-sensitively. The defaults are not overwritten when additional values added, but supplemented.

close_inactive_views::yes
Whether inactive (not visible) views in the editor should be closed. Closing them improves performances, as all open buffers are visited on activation and on modification of any single one.

console_log::no
Sets whether Urtext will log updates, errors, messages to the Python console. (In Sublime Text, press Control-backtick to open the console)

exclude_files::
Sets filenames in the project folder(s) to be excluded from the project, if any. (Default is empty.)

exclude_from_star::title - _newest_timestamp - _oldest_timestamp - _breadcrumb - def
When marking metadata using the * and ** syntax, these keys will get omitted, if present. For more information see | Propagating metadata to descendents >  The defaults are not overwritten when additional values added, but supplemented. Note _inline_timestamp is not overriden here.

filename_datestamp_format::%m-%d-%Y %I-%M %p
Specifies how dates will be formatted in filenames when the timestamp is included in the filename. Provided because some characters common in dates and times are not valid in filenames on certain platforms. Accepts the Python strftime format, see https://strftime.org/

filename_title_length::100
Sets a maximum title length (in characters) for filenames. See | RENAME_FILES() >

file_extensions::urtext
In project_settings, specifies file extensions for Urtext to compile in addition to .urtext. Only evaluated once, so reload the project if you change it. The dot is optional and is added if not supplied.

filenames::title
Specifies format for filenames when using | RENAME_FILES() >. Any metadata key used in the project is valid, in addition to the PREFIX placeholder, which will apply a numerical prefix to the outputted filename.

hash_key::keyword
The keyname to use for the hash metadata shortcut. See | Hash >

home::| Urtext Starter Project >
Identifies the home node for the project, connected to the "Home" key
Press Ctrl-Shift-H to go to the Home node of this documentation, | Urtext Starter Project >

meta_browser_key::
When browsing metadata, auto-selects a key so the first menu stage is skipped. Useful if you do not have many metadata keys or use only the hash key for metadata. See | Browse Metadata >

meta_browser_sort_keys_by::alpha
When using the metadata browser dropdown, specifies how to sort the options. Accepts 'alpha' or 'frequency'

meta_browser_sort_nodes_by::_oldest_timestamp
When using the metadata browser, specifies how to sort the nodes displayed. Accepts any metadata keys in the project, including system keys.

meta_browser_sort_values_by::alpha
Specifies how to sort the values in the metadata browser. Accepts 'alpha' or 'frequency'.

new_filenames_template::$device_keyname $timestamp
Specifies a filename template for new file nodes. Accepts format strings and arbitrary text.

new_file_node_format::$timestamp\n$device_keyname\n$cursor
Specifies the template for new file nodes. The following values can be strung together in any way:
- $timestamp
- $device_keyname
- $cursor
- any other Unicode characters are valid, including \n or \r for newlines, arbitrary text,  etc.

node_browser_sort::_oldest_timestamp - title
When browsing nodes, specifies how to sort the nodes. Accepts any metadata key in the project, including system keys. Sorts outer to inner in order left to right.

numerical_settings::_index - index - title_length - filename_title_length
Sets keys that should always be interpreted numerically for sorting and processing in dynamic output.

open_in_editor::urtext - txt - py

other_entry_points::
Specifies entry points for other projects to compile. Accepts a relative or absolute file path. Only evaluated once -- reload the project if you change it.

_lint::{ Lint Settings
  run_when_file_modified::yes
  lines_between_nodes::1
}

project_title::Starter Project
Provides a title for the entire project

rename_on_save::False
Specifies whether to rename files, if necessary, on each save. Takes true/false values.
See | RENAME_FILES() > for more information

timestamp_format::%a., %b. %d, %Y, %I:%M %p %Z
Set the format for timestamps globally. Accepts Python `strftime` and arbitrary text. For format strings, see https://strftime.org/

timezone::US/Eastern
Specifices a timezone to which the timestamp keys should be localized, or, if including a timezone in the `timestamp_format`, what timezone to include.

use_buffer::yes
Specifies whether to use the buffer directly, if available in the editor, instead of reloading the file, for buffer updates. Improves screwrite speed.

use_timestamp::
Specifies keys for which the timestamp should be returned as output instead of the text or numeric value.
