The Node List

	Every project maintains a list of all its nodes. The Node List is automatically written to a built-in file-level dynamic node. (More information on dynamic nodes in >01r). 

	To see the node list, press Ctrl-Shift-J. Like any node, the Node List can be traversed using Traverse Mode (>00w).

	In Sublime Text there is also the alternative of using the UI dropdown. Press Control-Shift-E or select "Urtext: Node List" from the Sublime command palette (Shift-Super-P). Here you can find a node by typing part of its title.

	In the Node List, nodes are sorted by their time of creation, with most recent first. They can also be sorted by index (see >00z). 

	The Node ID `zzz` is reserved for the Node list. (See >01l for more information on Node IDs)
