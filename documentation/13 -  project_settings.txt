The `project_settings` Node

This is the `project_settings` node for the "Urtext Documentation" Urtext project. In the metadata for this node you can specify a handful of settings for the project. (The text content of the node does not matter.)

The `project_settings` node is optional. To create one, make a node and use metadata to give it the title `project_settings`:

/-- ID:00l
Timestamp: <Sat., Jun. 08, 2019, 08:03 AM>
home: 01k
title: project_settings
tags: 
index: 100
 --/

This node now has special reserved metadata keys that will be parsed as follows:

{{ Home 

The Home page is accessible anywhere in the project by pressing Ctrl-Shift-H. Specify the node ID you want this shortcut to jump to. /-- ID:00c --/ }}

{{ Filename formats /-- ID:00i --/ }}

{{ Timestamp Formats /-- ID:00n --/ }}
