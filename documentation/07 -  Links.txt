Links                                                                                

{{  Linking to Nodes 

    To make a link, use the right angle bracket (>) followed immediately by a node ID. 

    Linking does not require a filename, only a Node ID. Any other information around the Node ID (such as the rest of the filename, or arbitrary text), will be ignored.

    You can also create a link that incorporates the target node as a child node. See Node Pointers (>00r).

    {{  Sublime Text tools to help with linking 

        Two Sublime Command Palette commands can make linking quick and easy:
     
        Urtext : Link To ...
            Links from the currently viewed node to another node which you can select in the selection panel. When you select a node in the quick panel, a link to that node will be inserted at the cursor.
 
        Urtext: Link From ...
            Links TO the current node FROM another node. When you select this command, a link to the current node will be copied to the clipboard. You can then paste the reference into the node you open in the quick panel.
            
            /-- ID:00m --/ }} 
        /-- ID: 0y2 --/ }}

{{ Opening Links
    
    Press Shift-Ctrl-/ on a line containing a link to open the node with the linked ID. If the linked is to an inline node, Sublime will scroll to and center its starting point. 

    Note that Urtext reads node regions on every save, so cursor location may be imprecise if the file has been altered since the last save.  
   /-- ID:01w --/ }}

{{  Viewing Linked Relationships
    
    Elaborate writing and reference systems such as wikis often linking nodes together in tangled and intricate ways. While Urtext cannot draw diagrams of this kind (called acyclic graphs) in plaintext, it can represent these relationships from the perspective of any one node: Position the cursor in the desired node and select "Urtext : Show Linked Relationships..." The currently selected node will be displayed as root; all nodes linking into this nodes, and recursively into those nodes, will be displayed above the root; all files linked from this node, and recursively from those nodes, will be displayed below. Circular references are represented up to one iteration.

    These diagrams are displayed as Sublime "scratch" views, meaning they will never report as being dirty (unsaved). They are intended for one-time/temporary use and will not update when a node/file changes. To make permanent and dynamically updated diagrams, see Dynamic Nodes (>01r).

    /-- ID:00q --/ }}


{{ Traverse Mode:   /-- ID:00w; title: Traverse Mode --/

        You can navigate a node tree or list of nodes by turning on Traverse mode (Shift-Ctrl-R). This will open another pane next to the one you are currently in. As you navigate the nodeview in the left side with the cursor or mouse, the selected node shows on the right. Use Sublime's Focus Group navigation keys, or the mouse, to switch between left and right panes.
        
        Toggle Traverse Mode off by pressing Shift-Ctrl-R again. The status bar at the bottom of the Sublime window indicates whether Traverse is on or off. 

        Note that if Traverse mode is off, you can also open a link manually (Shift-Ctrl-/) as normal. 

        This feature is not built into Urtext; it is a feature of the Sublime package only.
