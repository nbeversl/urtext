Metadata

    Metadata is data about data. As described in >01g, every newly-created node contains a metadata region with an ID and timestamp. The metadata region opens with a forward-slash followed by two dashes and closes with two dashes followed by a forward slash.

    Additional user-defined metadata region can be added into the same region, and additional metadata regions can be inserted arbitrarily anywhere inside a node.

    Each metadata entry is a user-defined key/value pair, separated by a colon, with the value containing an optional timestamp. Examples:

        /-- Purpose: work-related <Tue., Mar. 05, 2019, 03:25 PM> --/
        /-- kind: gift_list --/

    You can also string several entries together on one line, separated by semicolons:

        /-- note: example note ; tag: groceries --/

    Other than two reserved words (see below), metadata may have user-defined aribitrary keys and values. Keys and values of metadata tags are indexed automatically and searchable within the Urtext project (see >012). 

    Note that: 

        -   A colon separates the metadata key from the value 

        -   All three components are optional; any content preceding a colon (if one is present) is interpreted as a key; content following the (first) colon is interpreted as a value.

        -   A timestamp anywhere in the value will be indexed as the timestamp for the whole metadata entry. If you put more than one timestamp in an entry, only the first one is indexed.

        -   Indexing of metadata keys and values is not case-sensitive.

{{ Reserved Metadata Keys
                                                   
    There are two reserved metadata keys:

       {{   title
       
            If for you want to override the automatic title and assign a title manually, use title tag in the metadata block:
       
               /-- title: title (This tag overrides the default title)  --/
        /-- ID:00y --/ }}

       {{   index
       
            You can optionally add a two-digit sort index (00-99) to a node, such as:

               /-- index: 03 --/    

            Index tags will sort the files in the Node List (>01i) . Any indexed nodes will sort before (above) the others, with lowest number appearing first. 

            Remember unindexed notes display in order of creation, newest first. You can give the same index number to multiple nodes; in this case they sort with the most recent node first, within each index.
            /-- ID:00z --/ }}
          
    The only additional reserved metadata keys apply only to the project_settings node (>00l).
                   
    /-- ID:011 --/ }}

{{  Project Metadata List  /-- ID:012 --/

    Like the Node List (>01i), every project maintains a Metadata List, automatically written to a built-in file-level dynamic node. 

    To see the Metadata List, press Ctrl-Shift-U. Like any node, the Metadata List can be traversed using Traverse Mode (>00w). You can also link to it from anywhere by its node ID, like this: >zzy.

    In Sublime Text there is also the alternative of using the "Find By Meta" command in Command Palette. Press Control-Shift-E or select "Urtext: Metadata List" from the Sublime command palette (Shift-Super-P). 

    The Node ID `zzy` is reserved for the Metadata list. (See >01l for more information on Node IDs). To see the metadata list for the documentation, for instance, see node >>zzy.
