Nodes

Text is kept in nodes. Think of a node as a blank piece of paper, or a blank region of paper, either one with flexible and open-ended length.

A node can be a file but a file can also contain multiple nodes. In this system, it's clearer and more useful to think of text regions as nodes than as files.

{{ Node Identity (Node IDs)

 	 Nodes are uniquely identified by a three-character ID, automatically generated by Urtext on creation and placed into the initial metadata region. The identity of a node within Urtext persists no matter its containing filename.

	 Every node must have an ID; files with nodes missing IDs cannot be compiled and are omitted from the project.

	 If you accidentally delete a Node ID or need to insert one arbitrarily, press Control-Shift-I.

	 Node IDs have no special meaning except as a unique identifier. 
	 
	 That's all you need to know for this section. IDs are covered more in (>01q).

{{ File Level Nodes

	A file-level node is the node at the outermost level of a single file. It may or may not contain other nodes.

	To create a new empty file-level node press Control-Shift-; (Control-Shift-semicolon). The file is created, named and saved automatically. It has whitespace on top and a metadata block at the bottom containing a node ID and a timestamp of the creation date and time.

	By default, the first non-whitespace line of any node is the node's title. Write a title and anything else into the node. Save it with Super-S as usual.
