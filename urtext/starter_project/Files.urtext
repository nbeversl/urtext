Files _

Urtext looks for all files with the extension `.urtext` in the folder from which it is started.
Functionality is otherwise independent of filenames. Files will parse and function no matter their name.

Create a new Urtext file in an existing folder by pressing `Ctrl–Shift–;`  Urtext creates, names and opens new files automatically when you make a new file node. Using links and the Node Browser, you need never open a file manually or know its name or location, unless you want to.

Using Urtext, think about files as little as possible. Think of a file as the saved state of text buffer.

To include extensions other than `.urtext`, see the `file_extensions` key in | project_settings >
