Browse Metadata _ #action

|: Browse Metadata >

Shows a panel with all metadata keys in the project, then all values for the metadata key, then all nodes matching the selected key and value.

If your project is simpler and you want this action to show values for only one key, set that key as the meta_browser_key in | project_settings >

No default keybinding in Sublime Text; available in the | Show All Actions > Action
